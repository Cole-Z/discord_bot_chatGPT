# discord_bot_chatGPT

Helpful GPT3.5 model that is geared toward helping players in Minecraft. This is a very basic build as there is not Q & A happening over docs or other data. This is strictly the gpt 3.5 model. This bot is still useful if you would like to give it a try in your server. Just add env variables for the openai key and your discord bots token. Feel free to download a copy and customize the prompts to your use case. I hope this helps. 

You can chat per normal in DM"s, but you must use '!chat' command within text channels for Discord to interact with the bot. 
Thanks for checking it out!
